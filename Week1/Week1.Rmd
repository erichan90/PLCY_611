## 1.writing and Running code
### 1.1 Writing code
  Always write code in script or markdown so that your work can be reproduced. 
  You may want to click the button to write code in an r file to have a larger space for writing code.

### 1.2 Running code
  The code you run in the top will display below in the console
  You run the code by highlighting it and clicking the run button
  The shortcut on mac is Cmd+Return & the shortcun on Window is crtl+alt+enter

### 1.3
  #You can write comments by using the hashtag
  #Commented code will not be written
  print('The commented code will display in the console but will not be read as code')
  

## 2Import and save dataset
### 2.1 Import CSV
  CSV stands for comma separated variable and its one of the most common ways we'll be working with data   throughout this course. The basic format of a csv file is the first line indicating the column names and the rest of the rows/lines being data points separated by commas. One of the most basic ways to read in csv files in R is to use read.csv() which is built-in to R. 
      
  When using read.csv() you'll need to either pass in the entire path of the file or have the file be in the same directory as your R script. Make sure to account for possible spaces in the file path name, you may need to use backslashes to account for this. This is often a point of confusion for people new to programming, so make sure you understand the above before continuing!
```{r}
    #record the time
    ptm1 <- proc.time()
    # Pass in the entire file path if not in same directory
    ex <- read.csv('sales.csv')
    ## Stop the clock
    proc.time() - ptm1
    
    # Check structure
    str(ex)
    # Check the class 
    class(ex)
    # Check column names
    colnames(ex)
    # Check the observations
    head(ex)
    
```
### 2.2 Export CSV
```{r}
    #Export the sample file as csv
   write.csv(ex, file = "example.csv")
```
## 3Basic functions
```{r}
    #Sum of one variable
    #first need to convert the string variable to numeric 
    ex$Value<-as.numeric(gsub('[$,]', '',ex$Value))
    sum(ex$Value)    
    
    #Standard deviation of one variable
    sd(ex$Value)

    #Summary statistics of the dataset
    summary(ex)
``` 
## 4 Basic manipulations
```{r,message=FALSE}
    options(repos = list(CRAN="http://cran.rstudio.com/"))
    #install package
    install.packages("dplyr")
    #import the package
    library(dplyr)
```
### 4.1 Sort
```{r,message=FALSE}
    #Sort the dataset by Sale Rep & year in rising order
    ex2<-ex%>%
         arrange(Sales_Rep_Name,Year)
    head(ex2)
```
### 4.2 Subset sample
```{r}
    #Only select observations in 2011
    ex2011<-ex%>%
            filter(Year==2011)

    #Only select observations from John
    ex2011_Jonh<-ex2011%>%
            filter(Sales_Rep_Name%in%c("John"))
    
    #Finish subsetting in one chunk of code
    ex2011_Jonh2<-ex%>%
            filter(Year==2011&Sales_Rep_Name%in%c("John"))
    
    
    #select observations in either 2011 or 2012
    ex2011_12<-ex%>%
            filter(Year==2011|Year==2012)
    
  
    
```
### 4.3 Slice datasets
```{r}
    #show the first ten observations
    head(ex2011_12,10)
    
    #show the last ten observations
    tail(ex2011_12,10)
    
    # first sort the dataset by value and then show the Top 20 sales
    head(arrange(ex2011_12,desc(Value)),20)
    
    #Store the observations in a new dataset called 
    ex2011_12_top20<-head(arrange(ex2011_12,desc(Value)),20)
    
    #In addition to tail and head, we can also use [] to subset dataset
    #show the first ten observations
    ex2011_12_top20[1:10,]
    
    #show only first ten observations of the variables in 3-5 columns
    ex2011_12_top20[1:10,3:5]
``` 
    

### 4.4 Calculate the group average
   
```{r,message=FALSE}
 #calculate the yearly average and sum sale for each employee
    summary<-ex2%>%
          group_by(Sales_Rep_Name,Year)%>%
          summarise_at(vars(Value), list(Avg_value=mean,Tot_value=sum))

    print(summary)
  #calculate the representative sale average
    summary2<-ex2%>%
          group_by(Sales_Rep_Name)%>%
          summarise_at(vars(Value),list(Rep_avg=mean))
    
    print(summary2)
    
    #calcualte the yearly sale average
    summary3<-ex2%>%
          group_by(Year)%>%
          summarise_at(vars(Value),list(Year_avg=mean))
    
    print(summary3)
    
```
### 4.5 Merge datasets
```{r, message=FALSE}
   data<-merge(summary,summary2,by="Sales_Rep_Name")
   data2<-merge(data,summary3,by="Year")
```
### 4.6 Create new variables
```{r}
   data3<-data2%>%
          mutate(higher_hor=(Avg_value>Year_avg), #if the repersentative yearly average sale is higher than the yearly average, it is coded as one
                 higher_ver=(Avg_value>Rep_avg) #if the repersentative yearly average sale is higher than the his or her own average, it is coded as one
               )

  #print the newly created dataset3
  print(data3)
```
